#### HackMIT (Upcoming)
September 18 - 20, 2020

I am proud to have been accepted into HackMIT, one of the world's largest and most prestigeous hackathons, and look forwards to participating. 

#### Ignition Hacks (1st overall)
August 22 - 23, 2020

Summary: Ignition Hacks is a machine learning competition. We were given a NLP classification dataset of 1 million tweets, for which we had 2 days to optimize our solution for a private test set of 600 thousand tweets. I used roBERTa and 2 rounds of pseudolabelling, more details and source code available at the GitHub repo below. I worked solo and placed first overall out of over 400 participants.

Technologies: Huggingface Transformers, Tensorflow, Python

#### PeddieHacks (Most Unique Idea)
August 23, 2020

Summary: Peddiehacks was a competition where we were encouraged to make a funny submission. Our project was an AI based classifier between titles and images from the Animal Crossing and Doom subreddits. We used DistilBERT for NLP classification and MobileNetV2 for image classification. I worked on the machine learning components remotely alongside a friend, who was a web developer.

Technologies: Flask, Tensorflow, Python

#### Bridgehacks (Best Envromental hack)
July 17 - 18, 2020

Summary: We created a machine learning web application leveraging quantile regression that predicted the size and severity of wildfires from their starting coordinates, date, and start cause. We deployed it to Github Pages. 

Technologies: React.js, Tf.js, Tensorflow, Python

#### I/O Hacks Pandemic
May 29 - 31, 2020

Summary: We created an all-in-one webpage designed for facilitating social distancing by directing users to less busy stores through GPS tracking as well as providing a remote queue system so that users may stay in their cars while waiting for busy services. A QR code is provided to enter the store.

Technologies: Express, socket.io, Python
