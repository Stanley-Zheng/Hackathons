#### Ignition hacks
Summary: Ignitionhacks is a machine learning competition. We were given a NLP classification dataset of 1 million tweets, for which we had 2 days to optimize our solution on a test set of 600 thousand tweets. I used roBERTa and 2 folds of pseudolabelling, more details and source code available at the GitHub repo below.

#### PeddieHacks (Winner)
Summary: Peddiehacks was a competition where we were encouraged to make a funny submission. Our project was an AI based classifier between titles and images from the Animal Crossing and Doom subreddits. We used DistilBERT for NLP classification and mobilenet for image classification.

#### I/O Hacks 
Summary: We created an all-in-one webpage designed for facilitating social distancing by directing users to less busy stores through GPS tracking as well as providing a remote queue system so that users may stay in their cars while waiting for busy services. A QR code is provided to enter the store.
